# Skill / Agent Design Principles

The `mol` plugin is built around **harness engineering**: agents work
better when the repository gives them a small, well-shaped harness —
principled boundaries, predictable layers, and just enough scaffolding to
make safe defaults the obvious move. The aim is not to script every
agent action but to make the *next* agent that walks in succeed without
having to re-derive the rules.

These principles are enforced by `/mol:bootstrap`. Run it against
any project that has been bootstrapped with the mol harness to check
compliance. (The `molcrafts-harness/` marketplace repo itself has no
harness — use `/mol-plugin:check` for its self-audit.)

## 0. Harness Engineering

The harness should *constrain*, not *prescribe*.

- Give the agent **principles** (what's safe, what's risky, why).
- Give the agent **layers** (what kind of artifact lives where).
- Give the agent **judgment criteria** (when to write tests first, when
  to delegate, when to stop and ask).
- Do **not** force a fixed matrix of files, agents, or steps onto every
  project. The shape of the harness should follow the shape of the
  repository it lives in.

A skill or agent that prescribes ten exact steps is brittle. A skill
that names three principles and trusts the agent to apply them is
durable. Prefer the second.

## 1. Four-Zone Layering

Every well-shaped repository separates four kinds of content. Mixing them
poisons future agents because they cannot tell what they are reading.

```

`.claude/` follows Claude Code's project-level convention: everything
Claude Code or the mol harness reads lives under it. Inside, content
splits **active vs passive**:

- `.claude/notes/` — passive: outlives features, never auto-deleted.
  Note this is *not* `.claude/agents/` — that is Claude Code's folder
  for agent *definitions* (one file per agent, each defining a role).
  `.claude/notes/` is the agent's *project knowledge* (what the agent
  reads to understand this repo).
- `.claude/specs/` — active: intentionally ephemeral, deleted on done.
- `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/hooks/`,
  `.claude/settings.json` — Claude Code's own runtime configuration.

The four zones are still four because the conceptual split (public /
passive-internal / active-runtime / router) is what matters; nesting
the latter two under `.claude/` is just the spec-compliant filesystem
layout.

### Layering rules (L)

- **L1.** Public user docs live under `docs/`. Passive internal
  context (notes, decisions, contracts, handoffs, rubrics, debt log,
  open questions, project blueprint) lives under `.claude/notes/`.
  Active runtime artifacts (specs) live under `.claude/specs/`.
  Claude Code's own configuration (agents, skills, hooks, settings)
  lives directly under `.claude/`. `CLAUDE.md` is the router. Each
  category reads, writes, and references only its own kind.

- **L2.** Do not pollute `docs/` with agent contracts, handoffs,
  rubrics, specs, working memory, temporary plans, or private
  reasoning. Do not put public-user prose under `.claude/`. Do not
  put long-lived knowledge in `.claude/specs/` or directly under
  `.claude/` outside `.claude/notes/` — passive context goes in
  `.claude/notes/`, active runtime goes in `.claude/specs/`,
  Claude Code config goes in its conventional subfolders. Mixing
  passive content into `.claude/specs/` (or vice versa) breaks
  the active/passive contract that `/mol:impl`'s deletion behavior
  depends on.

- **L3.** `CLAUDE.md` is a short router (≤ ~150 lines is a good
  budget). It answers: *what is this repo?*, *where do things live?*,
  *what must never change casually?*, *what is the default workflow?*
  It links to files; it does not embed them. A CLAUDE.md that grows
  past two screens is a smell — promote sections to `.claude/notes/`
  and link.

- **L4.** Specs are alive. `/mol:spec` writes them under
  `.claude/specs/` with a checkbox-tracked Tasks section. `/mol:impl`
  ticks each box as work completes and deletes the spec file (plus
  its INDEX entry) on completion. A spec is never archived to
  `docs/` or `.claude/notes/`; once `done`, it is removed because
  the information that mattered is now in code, tests, and (when
  non-obvious) `.claude/notes/notes.md`.

## 2. Two-Layer Model

```
user ──▶ /skill  (workflow + orchestration, user-invocable)
              │
              ▼
          agent  (single expertise axis, never user-invocable directly)
              │
              ▼
       tools (Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, sometimes Write/Edit)
```

- **Skill** = a *verb* the user types (`/mol:impl`, `/mol:fix`). Owns
  the *procedure*: scope assessment, ordering, parallel fan-out, when
  to delegate, how to aggregate. A skill is short — it reads
  CLAUDE.md, classifies the request, calls one or more agents,
  summarizes.
- **Agent** = a *role* with one expertise. Owns *checks, knowledge,
  and edits inside its domain*. Stateless across invocations. Reached
  only through a skill.

The two layers must not collapse. A skill must not contain expert
knowledge that belongs in an agent. An agent must not contain workflow
choreography that belongs in a skill.

Which model runs each layer — the two conversation modes
(advisor / orchestration) and the opus / sonnet / haiku agent tiers —
is defined in `plugins/mol/rules/model-policy.md`; in orchestration
mode the main loop never authors production source.

## 2.5 Skill Invokers (user vs model)

Skills have a second axis beyond advisor/orchestration: **who may
fire them**. Borrowed from the [mattpocock productivity skills](
https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/tree/main/skills/productivity)
pattern (thin user entry + model-reachable body).

| Kind | Claude frontmatter | Codex (`skills/<name>/agents/openai.yaml`) | Who can fire it | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **User-invoked** | `disable-model-invocation: true` | `policy.allow_implicit_invocation: false` | Only the user typing the name | Zero description **context load**; pays human **cognitive load** |
| **Model-invoked** | omit the flag (default) | omit, or `allow_implicit_invocation: true` | User, model, **or another skill** | Description sits in the window every turn |

**Invoker rule.** If skill A auto-invokes skill B, B **must** be
model-invoked. User-invoked is only for deliberate human entry points
that no workflow must call. A user-invoked skill cannot be reached by
the model or by siblings — that is the point, and the footgun.

**When to split by invocation** (not every skill needs a pair):

- Keep **one** skill when it is only ever typed by hand *or* only
  ever reached as a subroutine — not both.
- Split into a **thin user entry** + **model-invoked body** when the
  same procedure must be (a) deliberately typed and (b) auto-invoked
  by other skills. Example: `/mol:grill` (user-only entry) → runs
  `/mol:grilling` (body; called by `/mol:discuss` and `/mol:spec`).

Pick model-invocation only when the agent must reach the skill on its
own, or another skill must. If it only ever fires by hand and nothing
in the chain calls it, make it user-invoked and pay no context load.

Canonical plan chain under this rule:

```
/mol:discuss ──converge──▶ /mol:grilling (plan)
                              │
                              ▼ (user types)
                          /mol:spec ──persist──▶ /mol:grilling (spec-audit)
                                                    │ holes → supersede in place
                                                    │ clean → /mol:impl-all (auto, end-to-end)
```

### Autonomy boundary

**Interactive (may wait on the human):** only `/mol:discuss`, `/mol:grill`,
`/mol:grilling`, and the interview turns inside `/mol:spec`'s post-persist
grill. Planning decisions are human.

**Fully agent-driven (never wait for approval / "what next?"):** implement,
close, simplify, commit, push, pr, tag, release, bench, web, ship gates,
fix/refactor apply loops once kicked, bootstrap repairs that are
mechanical. Closing a spec is **never** the human's job — `/mol:close`
auto-runs evaluators and agent-auto-attests remaining criteria.

Two publish chains (never mix them):

- **Harness marketplace:** `/mol-plugin:release` → commit → push → pr →
  merge → tag (plugins under `molcrafts-harness` only).
- **Ecosystem libraries:** `/mol:release` → dep/docs/harness gates →
  version bump → commit → push → pr → merge → tag. Dependencies on
  the official registry **before** dependents; tag-triggered CI
  publishes to crates.io / PyPI / npm when configured.

## 3. Why This Split

1. **Reusability.** Multiple skills delegate to the same agent (the
   `architect` agent is used by `/mol:impl`, `/mol:refactor`, and
   `/mol:review` — directly or via `--axis=arch`). One source of
   architecture rules, read by many skills.
2. **Parallelism.** Review-style skills fan out to multiple agents in
   one message; agents have isolated context windows so the
   orchestrator stays small.
3. **Safety.** Read-only agents (`architect`, `optimizer`, `scientist`,
   `compute-scientist`, `undergrad`, `pm`, `ci-guard`, `ffi-guard`,
   `reviewer`)
   cannot accidentally edit code; write-capable agents (`tester`,
   `documenter`) have edit rights only inside their declared scope.

## 4. Knowledge Hierarchy

```
.claude/notes/notes.md   evolving decisions, captured by /mol:note
        │
        ▼ promotion when stable
   CLAUDE.md  ◀──────── thin router — read by every agent
        │
        ▼
   skills/agents read from it; never duplicate it

.claude/specs/    active, checkbox-tracked plans; written by /mol:spec,
                  ticked + deleted by /mol:impl. Not knowledge —
                  ephemeral work-in-flight.
```

Every agent's first line is *"Read CLAUDE.md and the project's notes
file before running any checks."* Project-specific facts live in
CLAUDE.md (with the `mol_project:` frontmatter for machine-readable
keys) or in the notes file. Agent prompts hold only **unique
knowledge** the agent needs that does not belong in CLAUDE.md
(tolerances, anti-pattern catalogs, grep heuristics, floating-point
conventions).

## 5. Design Rules

### Layering (L)

See Section 1.

### Orthogonality (O)

- **O1.** Each agent owns exactly one expertise axis. If two agents
  would both answer the same question, merge or split until each has a
  unique axis.

  *Worked example — `architect` vs `librarian` boundary.* Both
  agents read the same shared artifact (`.claude/notes/architecture.md`,
  the project blueprint maintained by `/mol:map`), but they answer
  different questions and are wired into different scheduling
  points:

  - `architect` answers *"is the code currently in **compliance**
    with the layering rules?"* — this is the review/refactor-time
    validator. Output: emoji-prefixed findings.
  - `librarian` answers *"given a planned new capability, where
    does it go (**placement**) and is it already there (reuse)?"* —
    this is the spec-time consultant. Output: a fixed
    four-section advisory report.

  Sharing the artifact does not violate O1 because the verbs are
  disjoint (validate vs. consult); the unique-axis rule is about
  *the question answered*, not *the data read*.
- **O2.** Agents do not call other agents. The skill is the only
  orchestrator. *Exception:* a write-capable agent may produce code
  that a read-only agent later validates — but the validation call is
  made by the parent skill, not by the writer.
- **O3.** A skill names its delegates explicitly. There is no implicit
  routing.
- **O4.** A skill does not contain expert knowledge. If a check is
  non-trivial enough to need worked examples or reference data, it
  belongs in an agent.

### Knowledge locality (K)

- **K1.** CLAUDE.md is the single thin source of truth for stable
  rules. Every agent reads it first.
- **K2.** The project's notes file holds evolving decisions; `/mol:note`
  enforces conflict detection and promotes stable entries into
  CLAUDE.md (then deletes from the notes file).
- **K3.** Agent prompts contain only *unique knowledge* not in CLAUDE.md
  (heuristics, grep patterns, tolerances, anti-patterns). They never
  duplicate architecture rules.
- **K4.** Skill prompts contain only *workflow* (steps, when to
  delegate, output format). They never restate domain rules.

### Capability hygiene (C)

- **C1.** Read-only agents declare only Read/Grep/Glob/Bash. Granting
  Write/Edit must be justified by the agent's role (e.g. `tester`
  writes tests; `documenter` writes docs).
- **C2.** A skill that writes (specs, code, docs, tests, notes) must
  say so in its `description` frontmatter so the user knows what will
  change.
- **C3.** Diagnose-only skills (`/mol:debug`) state explicitly that
  they never edit. Enforced in the skill's procedure, not just in the
  description.

### Workflow shape (W)

- **W1.** Plan → Build → Verify → Document → Memory is the canonical
  loop. The `mol` plugin covers each phase.
- **W2.** RED before GREEN: `/mol:impl` must call the `tester` agent
  to write failing tests before any implementation is attempted.
- **W3.** Reviews fan out in parallel. `/mol:review` issues all
  delegate calls in one message.
- **W4.** Architecture validation happens at four points: scope
  assessment (planning), **spec-time librarian consult**
  (`/mol:spec` Step 4.5 — placement and reuse advice against the
  project blueprint at `.claude/notes/architecture.md`), after
  implementation, and after refactor. The spec-time consult is the
  fourth scheduling point and was added to plug the planning-phase
  visibility gap that produced duplicate modules and wrong-layer
  placement in large projects.
- **W5.** Bug fixing is a separate, minimal loop (`/mol:debug` →
  `/mol:fix`) not a degenerate case of `/mol:impl`.

### Output format (F)

- **F1.** Review-style agents output severity-sorted lines prefixed
  with an emoji: 🚨 Critical, 🔴 High, 🟡 Medium, 🟢 Low.
  ```
  🚨 file:line — message
    Fix: ...
  ```
  Skills aggregating multiple agents render a 🚨 / 🔴 / 🟡 / 🟢 table
  and a verdict (APPROVE / REQUEST CHANGES / BLOCK).
- **F2.** Skills end with a one-line user-facing summary suitable for
  scanning: files changed, tests passing, remaining TODOs.

### Idempotency (I)

- **I1.** Bootstrapping skills must be safe to re-run. They detect
  existing files and offer merge / replace / keep per entry instead of
  duplicating or silently overwriting.
- **I2.** Memory skills (notes promotion) must detect duplicates and
  contradictions before writing.
- **I3.** Generators that write managed sections must use stable
  markers so re-runs update in place rather than appending.

## 6. Re-Examination Checklist

`/mol:bootstrap` walks this checklist against any `.claude/`
tree. Output one finding per row: `<emoji> file:line — message` (🚨 /
🔴 / 🟡 / 🟢).

### Layering (L)

- [ ] Are public docs under `docs/`? Is `docs/` free of agent
      contracts, handoffs, working memory, rubrics, or specs? (L1, L2)
- [ ] Are passive internal artifacts (notes, decisions, debt log,
      handoffs, rubrics, contracts) under `.claude/notes/`? (L1)
- [ ] Are specs under `.claude/specs/` with a checkbox-tracked Tasks
      section? Are completed specs deleted (not archived)? (L4)
- [ ] Is `.claude/` free of long-lived knowledge? (only skills,
      agents, hooks, settings, and active specs) (L2)
- [ ] Is CLAUDE.md a thin router, not a manual? Does it route to
      `docs/`, `.claude/notes/`, and `.claude/` rather than embedding their
      content? (L3)

### Layer presence

- [ ] Are skills (`.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`) and agents
      (`.claude/agents/*.md`) both present, or is the project
      conflating the two?
- [ ] Does every user-visible verb live in a skill, not an agent?
- [ ] Is there a CLAUDE.md serving as the entry router?
- [ ] Does CLAUDE.md start with a `mol_project:` frontmatter block (if
      the project opts into the mol plugin contract)?

### Orthogonality

- [ ] List each agent and the question it answers. Are any two
      answering the same question? (O1)
- [ ] Do agents invoke other agents? (O2)
- [ ] Do skills name delegates explicitly? (O3)
- [ ] Does any skill embed expert knowledge that belongs in an agent?
      (O4)

### Knowledge

- [ ] Do agents read CLAUDE.md first? (K1)
- [ ] Is there a `/mol:note`-equivalent skill enforcing conflict
      detection and promotion? (K2)
- [ ] Do agent prompts duplicate CLAUDE.md content? (K3)
- [ ] Do skill prompts restate domain rules instead of pointing to
      CLAUDE.md? (K4)

### Capability

- [ ] Are read-only agents declared with read-only tools? Any
      unjustified Write/Edit? (C1)
- [ ] Does each writing skill announce what it writes? (C2)
- [ ] Are diagnose-only skills enforced in their procedure? (C3)

### Workflow

- [ ] Plan / Build / Verify / Document / Memory — is each phase
      covered? (W1)
- [ ] Does the implementation skill enforce RED before GREEN? (W2)
- [ ] Do review skills fan out in parallel? (W3)
- [ ] Are architecture checks scheduled at the three required points?
      (W4)
- [ ] Are debug and fix kept as separate minimal loops? (W5)

### Output

- [ ] Do review agents emit `<emoji> file:line` lines using 🚨 / 🔴 /
      🟡 / 🟢? (F1)
- [ ] Do skills end with a one-line user-facing summary? (F2)

### Idempotency

- [ ] Is the bootstrap skill safe to re-run? (I1)
- [ ] Does the notes skill detect duplicates and contradictions before
      writing? (I2)

### Per-project domain coverage

For a domain-heavy project, verify there is one agent per *axis of
risk* the project actually has. Every axis where the project can fail
silently must have its own agent, and every agent must map to a real
risk. No filler agents.

## 7. Anti-Patterns

These show up in repositories that were bootstrapped without harness
discipline. The audit flags each as 🟡 or higher.

- **Template sprawl.** A bootstrap dropped twelve skills and ten
  agents into a one-week-old repo, most of which never get invoked.
  Cure: start small, grow on demand.
- **Knowledge in `.claude/`.** Architecture rules, decisions, or
  domain notes embedded in a skill/agent body, or written into
  `.claude/` outside of `.claude/specs/`. Cure: promote to CLAUDE.md
  or `.claude/notes/` and leave a reference.
- **Specs in `.claude/notes/` or `docs/`.** Specs are alive — they belong in
  `.claude/specs/`. Putting them next to passive notes is a category
  error. Cure: move under `.claude/specs/` and add a Tasks checklist.
- **Specs without checkboxes.** A spec with no Tasks section can't be
  ticked, can't be tracked, and can't be auto-deleted. Cure: re-run
  `/mol:spec` to add a concrete checklist.
- **Done specs left around.** A spec marked `done` but still on disk
  is clutter. Cure: `/mol:impl` should have deleted it; if it
  didn't, delete manually and capture any non-obvious context with
  `/mol:note`.
- **Contracts in `docs/`.** Agent handoff contracts or review rubrics
  living next to user tutorials. Cure: move under `.claude/notes/`.
- **CLAUDE.md as manual.** A 600-line CLAUDE.md that nobody reads.
  Cure: split into `.claude/notes/architecture.md`, `.claude/notes/conventions.md`,
  etc. and link.
- **Fake precision.** A bootstrap that invented architecture rules
  with no evidence in the codebase. Cure: record as an open question
  in `.claude/notes/open-questions.md` instead.
- **Agent calling agent.** Implicit routing through agent bodies.
  Cure: hoist orchestration into a skill.
- **One-shot skills with no idempotency.** Re-running them duplicates
  files or clobbers user content. Cure: detect and merge.
