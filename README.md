# MolCrafts plugin marketplace

A Claude Code-first plugin marketplace for the MolCrafts workspace, with a
native Codex marketplace and manifests that reuse the same skill workflows.
Claude Code remains the canonical runtime and project-harness format.

It supports Atomiverse, molpy, molexp, molrs, molvis, molq, and molnex, built around
**harness engineering**: small, well-shaped harnesses with principled
boundaries (public docs / passive internal context / runtime + active
artifacts / thin router) so the next agent that walks in succeeds
without re-deriving the rules.

## Plugins

| Plugin | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`mol`](plugins/mol/README.md) | Day-to-day project work, organized around the planner→generator→evaluator harness pattern: `/mol:bootstrap` (harness lifecycle — initialize, audit, repair) → `/mol:spec` (planner — self-validates spec quality and negotiates the binding `<slug>.acceptance.md` contract, with each `ac-*` carrying a `status: pending → verified / failed` ledger) → `/mol:impl` (generator — refuses without both files; parks at `status: code-complete` until runtime evaluators verify their criteria) → `/mol:review [--axis=<name>]` (unified static evaluator; aggregates 10 single-axis reviewers via the `reviewer` agent) → `/mol:web` (runtime UI evaluator; uses whatever browser-automation MCP you installed). Plus `/mol:fix`, `/mol:refactor`, `/mol:simplify` (apply janitor hygiene + enforce the language-canonical toolchain trio: ruff + ty / biome + tsc / cargo fmt + clippy + cargo check), `/mol:ship`, git workflow chain, …. Adapts to each project via `mol_project:` frontmatter. |
| [`mol-plugin`](plugins/mol-plugin/README.md) | Maintaining this marketplace: scaffold skills, run deterministic audits, smoke-test Claude/Codex installation, clean up content, and cut releases. |

## Install

### Claude Code (primary)

```
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/MolCrafts/molcrafts-harness
/plugin install mol@molcrafts
```

`mol-plugin` is only needed if you are developing the plugins
themselves; most users skip it.

For local development, `/plugin marketplace add <path-to-this-checkout>`
works too. Restart the session or `/reload-plugins` to pick up new
skills.

### Codex

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add MolCrafts/molcrafts-harness
codex plugin add mol@molcrafts
```

For local development, run
`codex plugin marketplace add <path-to-this-checkout>`. Restart Codex and use a
new thread after changing plugin skills so the installed plugin cache is
refreshed. Codex reads `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` and each plugin's
`.codex-plugin/plugin.json`; it does not rely on the legacy Claude marketplace
fallback.

Both platforms load the same `plugins/<plugin>/skills/` files. Codex-specific
tool, subagent, and path translation lives in `skills/CODEX.md`, so workflow
changes remain single-source.

## Adopt in a project

1. Install `mol` (above).
2. From the project root, run `/mol:bootstrap`. It inspects the
   repo, asks what to add, and installs only what's justified
   (CLAUDE.md + `.claude/notes/` for passive context + `.claude/specs/`
   for active work, plus the `mol_project:` frontmatter when you opt
   into the mol contract).
3. Smoke-test with `/mol:bootstrap` (re-run to verify harness health)
   and `/mol:review --axis=arch` (architecture).

Each project's harness is rewritten in place rather than migrated in
phases — this is continuous iteration. When the plugin is upgraded
later, run `/mol:bootstrap` to refresh templates and frontmatter.
